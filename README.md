# BilMart
Bilmart is a web app that allows the Bilkent University community to: buy or sell second-hand items, borrow or donate, and make posts for lost and found items.

## Motivation
To enhance the Bilkent experience by allowing students and members to more easily find second-hand items and more.
## Goals
Build a platform for Bilkenters to: buy or sell second-hand items, borrow or donate, and find lost and found items.
## Problem
At the start of every semester, many students need to purchase new books for their new courses; however, the textbooks are costly, and some students struggle to buy brand-new ones. Many students choose to buy second-hand books from friends or through Instagram or Facebook. However, sometimes it is hard to find the book you are looking for, or you may not know anyone selling the book. So, this web platform will allow students to find the books they seek.
