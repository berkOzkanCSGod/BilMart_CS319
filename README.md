# BilMart
Bilmart is a web app that allows the Bilkent University community to: buy/sell second hand items, borrow items, get donations, and find lost and found items. 

## Motivation
To enhance the Bilkent experince by allowing students to more easily find second hand items and more. 
## Goals
Build a platform for Bilkenter to: buy/sell second hand items, borrow items, get donations, and find lost and found items. 
## Problem
At the start of every semester many students need to buy new books for their new courses, however, the textbooks are very expensive and some students struggle to buy brand new ones. Many students choose to buy second hand books from friends or through instagram. However, sometimes it is hard to find the book you are looking for or you may not know anyone selling the book. So, this web platform will allow students to find the books they are looking for.
