# BilMart
Bilmart is a web app that allows the Bilkent University community to: buy or sell second-hand items, borrow or donate, and make posts for lost and found items.
## Motivation
BilMart is elaborately designed to enhance the Bilkent experience by allowing students and members of our community to find second-hand items and more in a faster and easier fashion.
## Goals
Building a platform for Bilkenters to: buy or sell second-hand items, borrow or donate desired items, and provide a place to look for lost and found items.
## Problem
At the start of every semester, many students need to purchase new books for their new courses; however, the textbooks are costly, and some students struggle to buy brand-new ones. Many students choose to buy second-hand books from friends or through Instagram or Facebook. However, sometimes it is hard to find the book you are looking for, or you may not know anyone selling the book. So, this web platform will allow students to find the books or other items that they seek.
## Features
- Posting lost items with images. If the owner of the item finds the post, they can message the user to get their item back.
- Users who post lost items will be instructed to obscure information about the item so that they can verify the users who claim that item.
- Posting secondhand items they wish to sell or put up for rent.
- Users can give course tags to their post. For example a book for CS223 can be tagged with that course
- Users can also categorize their posts by item type such as book, clothing, electronics etc.
- Users can open donations and set a donation goal.
- There will be a search engine that lets users find the items or posts they are looking for, and the ability to sort posts based on post type, item category, and tags.
